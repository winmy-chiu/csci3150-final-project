                <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
                <p>Universal design involves creating products and environments that can be utilized by everyone to the fullest extent, minimizing the necessity for adjustments or specialized designs.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Norman's Design Concepts</h2>
                <h3>1 - Affordance</h3>
                <p>  Affordances are the perceived and actual properties of an object that suggest how it can be used. They provide clues to users about the possible actions they can take with an object. </p>
                <details class="some_paddings">
                    <summary>Example</summary>
                    <p>A button on a website affords clicking, while a handle on a door affords pulling or pushing.</p>
                </details>
                <h3>2 - Constraints</h3>
                <p> Constraints are limitations or restrictions intentionally imposed on a design to guide users and prevent unintended actions. Constraints help users understand the permissible range of interactions. </p>
                <details class="some_paddings">
                    <summary>Example</summary>
                    <p>A physical constraint is a key that only fits into a lock in one orientation, preventing users from inserting it incorrectly.</p>
                </details>
                <h3>3 - Feedback</h3>
                <p> Feedback is the information provided to users about the results of their actions. It helps users understand the system's response and aids in making informed decisions. </p>
                <details class="some_paddings">
                    <summary>Example</summary>
                    <p>A progress bar that shows the status of a file upload provides feedback to the user about the ongoing process.</p>
                </details>
                <h3>4 - Visibility</h3>
                <p> Visibility refers to the clarity and prominence of an object or interface element. It should be immediately apparent to users, reducing the need for exploration or guesswork. </p>
                <details class="some_paddings">
                    <summary>Example</summary>
                    <p>Clearly labeled navigation menu items that are visible on a website ensure users can easily find and access different sections.</p>
                </details>
                <h3>5 - Mapping</h3>
                <p> Mapping involves the relationship between controls and their effects, making the connection between the user's actions and the system's response intuitive and straightforward. </p>
                <details class="some_paddings">
                    <summary>Example</summary>
                    <p>The layout of buttons on a remote control should correspond logically to the functions of the devices they control.</p>
                </details>
                <h3>6 - Consistency</h3>
                <p> Consistency involves maintaining uniformity in design elements and interactions throughout a system or product. It helps users build a mental model of how the system works. </p>
                <details class="some_paddings">
                    <summary>Example</summary>
                    <p>Consistent use of colors, fonts, and button placements across a website or application contributes to a cohesive and predictable user experience.</p>
