                <h2>Why do we need <abbr title="Universal Design">UD</abbr>?</h2>
                <p>
                    Universal design is important and needed for several compelling reasons. Firstly, it promotes inclusivity by ensuring that products, 
                    environments, and systems are accessible to the widest range of individuals, regardless of age, ability, or background. In doing so, it breaks down barriers 
                    and creates equal opportunities for people with diverse characteristics to participate fully in society. Universal design anticipates and accommodates the varying needs 
                    of individuals, acknowledging that abilities and circumstances can change over time. This inclusivity not only aligns with ethical principles of fairness and 
                    equality but also contributes to the overall well-being of communities by fostering a sense of belonging and participation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, as demographics shift and populations age, the importance of universal design becomes even more pronounced. An aging population brings a greater prevalence of 
                    diverse abilities and requirements. By incorporating universal design principles, products and environments can be made age-friendly, accommodating the specific needs 
                    associated with aging, such as reduced mobility or sensory impairments. This proactive approach not only enhances the quality of life for older individuals but also 
                    prepares societies for the challenges and opportunities associated with an increasingly diverse and aging population. Ultimately, universal design is essential for 
                    creating a more inclusive, sustainable, and compassionate world that values the dignity and contributions of every individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Universal design is the process of creating products that are accessible to people with a wide range of abilities, disabilities, and other characteristics. Universally 
                    designed products accommodate individual preferences and abilities; communicate necessary information effectively (regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory 
                    abilities); and can be approached, reached, manipulated, and used regardless of the individual's body size, posture, or mobility. Application of universal design principles
                     minimizes the need for assistive technology, results in products compatible with assistive technology, and makes products more usable by everyone, not just people with 
                     disabilities.

                <p>Universal Design is “a design process that enables and empowers a diverse population by improving human performance, health and wellness, and social participation” (Steinfeld and Maisel, 2012).
