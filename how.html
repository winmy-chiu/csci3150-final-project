                <h2>What are the Tools?</h2>
                <h3>W3 Validator</h3>
                <p>The W3 validator can take in website URL, file upload, or text input. It analyzes the syntax of a given web page and identifies any 
                    errors or warnings in the markup code. Web developers use the W3 validator during the development process to catch and fix errors in their code, 
                    improving the overall quality and compatibility of their websites. By validating web documents, developers can enhance the accessibility, 
                    interoperability, and future-proofing of their websites, promoting a more consistent and reliable user experience on the internet.</p>
                <h3>Adobe Color</h3>
                <p>Adobe Color Contrast Analyzer is a tool designed to assist web developers and designers in creating websites that adhere to principles of universal 
                    design, particularly in terms of accessibility. The analyzer focuses on color contrast, an essential aspect for ensuring that content is easily readable 
                    for users with visual impairments or disabilities. By evaluating the color combinations used in a website's design, the tool identifies potential issues 
                    related to contrast ratios, helping developers conform to accessibility standards such as those outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). 
                    This ensures that text and interactive elements maintain sufficient contrast against their background, making the content more legible for individuals with 
                    color vision deficiencies or low vision. Ultimately, the Adobe Color Contrast Analyzer contributes to the creation of websites that are more inclusive,
                     providing a positive user experience for a diverse audience and aligning with the principles of universal design.</p>
                <h3>WAVE Evaluation Tool</h3>
                <p>The WAVE Evaluation Tool, is a comprehensive web accessibility evaluation tool designed to assist developers and designers in creating universally accessible websites. 
                    WAVE is a browser extension that can be integrated with popular browsers. WAVE provides visual feedback by annotating web pages with indicators and highlighting 
                    elements that may pose challenges for users with disabilities. It checks for issues such as missing alternative text for images, proper use of headings, color contrast, 
                    and other elements crucial for accessibility. By using the WAVE Evaluation Tool, developers can identify and address accessibility barriers, ensuring that their websites 
                    are inclusive and usable by a diverse audience, including individuals with disabilities. This contributes to the principles of universal design, promoting a more 
                    accessible and equitable online experience for everyone.</p>
                <h3>HTML5 Outliner</h3>
                <p>The HTML5 Outliner is a tool designed to analyze the structure of HTML documents, providing a hierarchical outline of the content based on the heading and 
                    sectioning elements. This tool is particularly beneficial for creating universally designed websites that prioritize accessibility. By using semantic HTML5 
                    elements such as headings (h1-h6), articles, sections, and navigation, developers can ensure a well-organized and logically structured content hierarchy with 
                    no untitled sections. The HTML5 Outliner helps in visualizing this structure, making it easier for developers and designers to identify and rectify any 
                    potential issues related to document organization. Proper document structure enhances screen reader navigation, assists in keyboard navigation, and contributes
                     to an overall better user experience for people with diverse abilities, ultimately fostering inclusivity in web design.
                </p>
                <h3>Google Fonts</h3>
                <p>Google Fonts is a free and extensive collection of web fonts provided by Google, offering a wide range of typefaces that can be easily integrated into websites.
                     This resource plays a crucial role in promoting universal design by enhancing accessibility and inclusivity on the web. With a diverse selection of fonts that
                      cater to various languages, styles, and readability preferences, Google Fonts enables web designers to choose typefaces that accommodate users with different
                       visual needs. Moreover, the simplicity of integrating Google Fonts into websites allows developers to enhance the aesthetics of their designs without 
                       compromising performance.</p>

            <h2>Some HTML5 Semantics</h2>
            <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.</p>

            <p>Examples of non-semantic elements: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> which tells nothing about its content.</p>
